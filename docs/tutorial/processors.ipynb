    "Processors are plugins that can execute code on certain events. For more information on those events check the [class documentation](../../ref/api/processors.rst).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see processors as an alternative way of dealing with the results of a task, however, it has a few advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Due to its event-based nature, you can process the events asynchronously. This means that you will be processing the result of a host exactly once the host is completed without the need to wait for the rest of the hosts to complete.\n",
    "2. Because you are tapping into events code is more concise and easier to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how processors work with a few examples. Let's start by loading the nornir object and some libraries we will need:"

Registering plugins
-------------------

Starting with nornir3 some plugins need to be registered in order to be used. In particular:

* inventory plugins
* transform functions
* connection plugins
* runners

To do so you can use `entry points <https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#dynamic-discovery-of-services-and-plugins>`_ or programmatically.

Using entrypoints in your ``setup.py``::

    setup(
        # ...
        entry_points={
          "PATH": "NAME = path.to:Plugin",
        }
    )

In your pyproject.toml if using ``poetry``::

    [tool.poetry.plugins."PATH"]
    "NAME" = "path.to:Plugin"

Where PATH is:

* ``nornir.plugins.inventory`` - for inventory plugins
* ``nornir.plugins.transform_function`` - for transform functions
* ``nornir.plugins.runners`` - for runners
* ``nornir.plugins.connections`` - for connection plugins

Where NAME is the way you want to refer to it later on and ``path.to:Plugin`` the import path. For instance::

    [tool.poetry.plugins."nornir.plugins.inventory"]
    "inventory-name" = "path.to:InventoryPlugin"


To do it programmatically import the correct plugin register and use the ``register`` method. For instance::

    from nornir.core.plugins.inventory import InventoryPluginRegister

    from path.to import InventoryPlugin


    InventoryPluginRegister.register("inventory-name", InventoryPlugin)

Connections

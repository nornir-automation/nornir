Configuration
=============

The configuration is comprised of a set of sections and parameters for those sections. You can set the configuration programmatically using nornir by passing a dictionary of options for each section, by using a YAML file, by setting the corresponding environment variables or by a combination of the three. The order of preference from less preferred to more preferred is "env variable" -> "configuration file" -> "code".

An example using ``InitNornir`` would be::

    nr = InitNornir(
        runner={"plugin": "threaded", "options": {"num_workers": 20}},
        logging={"log_file": "mylogs", "level": "DEBUG"}
    )

A similar example using a ``yaml`` file:

.. include:: ../howto/advanced_filtering/config.yaml
   :code: yaml

Logging
------------

| By default, Nornir automatically configures logging when ``InitNornir`` is called. Logging configuration can be modified and available options are described in the section below. If you want to use Python logging module to configure logging, make sure to set ``logging.enabled`` parameter to ``False`` in order to avoid potential issues.
| In some situations Nornir will detect previous logging configuration and will emit :obj:`nornir.core.exceptions.ConflictingConfigurationWarning`

Next, you can find each section and their corresponding options.

.. include:: parameters.rst

user_defined
------------

You can set any ``<k, v>`` pair you want here and you will have it available under your configuration object, i.e. ``nr.config.user_defined.my_app_option``.

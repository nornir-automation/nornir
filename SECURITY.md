## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability feel free to reach out privately on [GitHub](https://github.com/nornir-automation/nornir/security/advisories/new) so we can fix before a public disclosure.
If the issue is on a dependency feel free to open a PR bumping such dependency without contacting us first.
